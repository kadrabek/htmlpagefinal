By now you should have a plan for the website you want to create which includes the wireframe. Continue working on it by setting up your structure with HTML5 elements.
 - Create at least 1 HTML page for your final project website. 
 - Elements should include a body, nav, sections, aside, footer, etc. organized appropriately
 - Include a description of what the page(s) output in a readme.txt
 - Use well-formatted, easy-to-read, and commented code
